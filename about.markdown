Hey! My name is Raj and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cultivate](https://cultivate.com/),
a startup building an AI-powered leadership development platform.

I work at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing.
I'm familiar with modern NLP techniques (Transformers, Attention) and the APIs used to implement
them (HuggingFace, PyTorch). I'm also proficient with implementing these machine learning models as
components to real-world software systems.

My knowledge of machine learning has been mostly acquired through experience and self-study. I don't have a
Master's degree and don't plan on getting one anytime soon! I'm a passionate self-starter who's determined
to learn and make a positive impact. Particularly, I'm interested in using machine learning to better understand
people - its applications in natural language processing, psychology, and mental health constantly amaze me.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, running, and hanging out with my dog.
