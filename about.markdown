Hey! My name is Raj and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cultivate](https://cultivate.com/),
a San Francisco startup building an AI-powered leadership development platform.

I work at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing.
I work extensively with modern NLP techniques (Transformers, Attention) and the APIs used to implement
them (HuggingFace, PyTorch). I'm also proficient with implementing these machine learning models as components to real-world software systems.

My knowledge of machine learning has been acquired through experience, textbooks, and online resources. I'm a passionate self-starter who's determined
to learn and make a positive impact. Particularly, I'm interested in using machine learning to better understand
people - its applications in natural language processing, psychology, and mental health constantly amaze me.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, running, and hanging out with my dog.
